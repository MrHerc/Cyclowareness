# Cyclowareness

**Closed-loop cybersecurity awareness platform.** Real threats become personalized training — automatically. *Learn, detect, neutralize — and repeat.*

Cyclowareness analyzes real threats in a secure sandbox, uses AI to convert each threat into micro-training targeted at the specific employees most at risk, measures the resulting behavioral change through a quantified risk score, and feeds every result back into the system. It learns from real attacks, not templates.

## The loop (the invention)

        └──────────────────────── (7) FEEDBACK: results update the risk model ──────┘
```

Every full pass is a persisted, auditable **LoopRun**. The analyst dashboard renders the loop turning in real time; a stalled or failed stage is surfaced, never dropped. Between CONVERT and TARGET sits a **human-in-the-loop gate**: an analyst reviews (and can edit) every AI-generated module before anyone receives it.

## Quick start (demo build — zero external services)

Prerequisites: Python 3.12+, Node 20+.

```bash
# 1. Backend (SQLite + mock sandbox + mock AI — the full loop works offline)
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt        # Windows
.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000

# 2. Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173  (proxies /api → :8000)
```

The database is created and seeded automatically on first start (fictional company *Caspian Dynamics*: 26 employees, 6 months of metric history, past loop runs, an active simulation, a triage queue and a run already waiting for approval).

### Demo accounts

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Security Analyst | `analyst@caspiandynamics.az` | `analyst123` |
| Employee (Finance) | `leyla.aliyeva@caspiandynamics.az` | `demo123` |
| Employee (high-risk) | `rashad.mammadov@caspiandynamics.az` | `demo123` |
| Employee (champion) | `aysel.huseynova@caspiandynamics.az` | `demo123` |
| Executive (read-only) | `exec@caspiandynamics.az` | `exec123` |

### 3-minute exhibition script

1. **Analyst** → Intel Feed → *Push into the loop* on any item. Watch the run travel INGEST → ANALYZE → CONVERT live on the run page.
2. The run pauses at the **approval gate** — review the AI-generated micro-training (edit if you like) → *Approve & continue*.
3. TARGET selects the at-risk employees **with visible rationale** (targeted, not blasted); TRAIN assigns.
4. **Sign in as Rashad** (high risk) → his portal shows the new assignment and *why he* received it → complete the 3-minute module → his risk score visibly drops.
5. **Back as analyst** → the run's MEASURE/FEEDBACK stages close the loop; the dashboard's click-rate/report-rate charts and department heatmap are the before/after proof.
6. Optional: Employee portal → *Report suspicious* (one-click human sensor) → the report lands in the analyst triage queue with AI assist → push it into the loop: the cycle restarts.

Three deliberately pluggable seams, all selected by config — the loop code never changes:

| Seam | Config | Demo default | Production option |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sandbox | `SANDBOX_ANALYZER` | `mock` (realistic deterministic verdicts) | `real` → **VirusTotal adapter fully implemented** (submit URL → poll analysis → normalise verdict + IOCs) in `analyzers/real_analyzer.py`; CAPEv2 self-hosted flow documented as a deployment TODO |
| Task queue | `TASK_RUNNER` | `inprocess` (asyncio background tasks) | `celery` → Redis + Celery workers (adapter in `core/task_runner.py`) |
| AI | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | empty → deterministic `MockAIProvider` | set key → live Claude calls (`AI_MODEL`, default `claude-sonnet-5`) |
| Database | `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite file | PostgreSQL (`postgresql+psycopg://…`), JSON columns are JSONB-compatible |

### Turning on the real integrations

Both are pure configuration — the loop code never changes:

```bash
# Live AI (real Claude-generated training per threat)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # in backend/.env
AI_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5

# Real sandbox (VirusTotal URL/hash reputation)
SANDBOX_ANALYZER=real
REAL_ANALYZER_BACKEND=virustotal
REAL_ANALYZER_API_KEY=<your-vt-api-key>
```

With the AI key set, `ai_service` routes every generation through Claude and
falls back to the deterministic mock only if a call fails or returns malformed
output. With the VirusTotal backend, the ANALYZE stage extracts the artifact's
URL, submits it, polls the analysis to completion and maps VT's engine stats to
the same analyzer contract the mock produces — so the dashboard, targeting and
training are identical whether the verdict came from the mock or the real world.

**No live malware is ever executed inside the web application.** Real detonation belongs to an external sandbox behind the `RealAnalyzer` adapter; the analyzer contract is:

```json
{
  "verdict": "malicious | suspicious | benign",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "threat_type": "phishing | malware | smishing | quishing | bec | other",
  "iocs": {"urls": [], "domains": [], "hashes": [], "sender_patterns": []},
  "behavior_summary": "short text",
  "raw_report": { }
}
```

## The risk model (transparent by design)

Score 0–100 per employee; baseline `20 + role_sensitivity × 20`; every movement is a persisted `RiskEvent` (the audit trail shown in the UI). Weights (`backend/app/core/risk_engine.py`):

| Signal | Δ |
|---|---|
| Clicked a simulated phishing lure | **+12** |
| Exposed (targeted) by a real threat | **+8** |
| Ignored assigned training (expired) | **+4** |
| Completed training but failed quiz | **+3** |
| Reported a real suspicious artifact | **−4** |
| Completed a training module | **−4** |
| Quiz comprehension (scaled by score) | **−6 × score** |
| Reported a simulated phish | **−5** |

The current score is the direct input to the TARGET stage — riskier people are trained first, and their improvement changes who gets targeted next time. That is the feedback that closes the loop.

## AI engine (`backend/app/ai/`)

All Claude calls live behind `ai_service` with strict output schemas, defensive JSON parsing, and graceful fallback to the deterministic mock. Prompts are versioned files in `ai/prompts/`:

- `training_generation` — sandbox analysis → personalized micro-module (lesson, 3–5 question quiz, takeaway)
- `threat_explanation` — technical verdict → plain language for employees
- `triage_assist` — reported artifact → indicators + IOCs for the analyst
- `executive_briefing` — metrics → natural-language posture summary

## Production deployment

`docker-compose.yml` ships the full production topology (PostgreSQL + Redis + API). Steps to harden:

1. Set a real `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres) and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment — never in code.
2. Enable Celery: `TASK_RUNNER=celery`, run workers (`celery -A app.worker worker`), wire the task in `core/task_runner.py` (documented TODO).
3. Enable a real sandbox: `SANDBOX_ANALYZER=real` + backend credentials (see `analyzers/real_analyzer.py`).
4. Replace the seeded demo users with your identity provider.

## Non-goals (by design)

No public news portal (the feed is input-only and minimal), no from-scratch detonation engine, no live malware in the web app, no long generic courses, no all-in-one enterprise suite. If a feature doesn't feed the cycle, it was cut.
